        <p>Soft Pizza is easy to make for kids' snacks or as an appetizer. It will take only 20 minutes of your time, if you have a bread machine.</p>
        <p><em>Serves: 10</em></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>280 millliliters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk">milk</a></li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>150 grams melted butter</li>
            <li>600 grams flour</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 packet bread yeast, I prefer Active dry</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I  make the dough with the bread machine. Load the ingredients into the machine and set the program for fresh dough. The dough will be ready in 1/5 hours. IMPORTNANT: the ingredients should be placed in the bread machine in the exact order as listed above, liquids first
            </li>
            <li>If you don't have a bread machine you can find the instructions on my website: http://yourguardianchef.com/recipe/brioche-bread-rolls-dough-without-a-bread-machine/
            </li>
            <li>Before you take out the dough from the bread machine basket, make sure you have sprinkled the surface of the bard with plenty of lour. The dough will be sticky so you need to coat it with flour immediately to stop it from sticking to your hands.
            </li>
            <li>Cover a 26X35 cm pan with baking paper, and coat the base and the side with plenty of olive oil. Put the dough in the center of the pan and stretch it downwards using your fingers, it is very soft.
            </li>
            <li>Fill the top of the dough with 60 gr of fresh tomato sauce, grated mozzarella, 120 gr of shredded ham, and drizzle with olive oil. You can also choose different ingredients, see more ideas above.
            </li>
            <li>With your fingers, press down the ingredients inside the dough so that when it rises the ingredients will be trapped in side the dough, making it moister and locking in the flavor throughout the pizza. The pizza needs to rest for 30 minutes to leven.
            </li>
            <li>Once it rises, cook it in a hot oven at 180C for 30 minutes. When ready, let it rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board and when cold cut it into strips.
            </li>
        </ol>
